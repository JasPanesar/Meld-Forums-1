Meld Forums is a forums plugin for Mura CMS. It is distributed under the Open Source GPL 2.0 license.

MF is a fully-featured forum that includes locale support, its own set of events for extending, and the ability to skin the forum. 

Features include:

* Unlimited Forums
* Integration with Mura permissions
* Avatars and attachments
* Deep permission/configuration settings which can be applied to all or individual forums
* New Bootstrap back end
* Secure BBML editor for content
* 

Current version is 2.1 (in the Bootstrap Branch). Note that the Bootstrap branch is the latest version, and as the name suggests
this is to bring it into line with the latest Mura CMS migration to the Bootstrap framework.

** New Bootstrap front end coming soon
